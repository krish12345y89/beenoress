# **1. P–N Junction Diode**

---

## **English Explanation (Easy Language)**

* A **diode** is a two-terminal electronic device.
* It is made by **joining P-type semiconductor** and **N-type semiconductor** together.
* The junction formed between P and N region is called **P–N junction**.
* It allows **current in one direction only** (Forward bias) and **blocks current in the opposite direction** (Reverse bias).
* So, diode works like a **one-way valve** for electric current.

## **Hindi (Hinglish, Simple Language)**

* **Diode ek 2 terminal device hai.**
* Ye banta hai jab hum **P-type semiconductor (jahaan holes zyada hote h)** aur **N-type semiconductor (jahaan electrons zyada hote h)** ko jod dete h.
* Dono ke beech banne wali line ko bolte h **P-N Junction**.
* Diode ka kaam hai current ko **ek hi side flow hone dena** (Forward Bias), aur dusri side **roak dena** (Reverse Bias).
* Matlab diode ek **ek-tarfa current gate** ki tarah kaam karta h.

## **Symbol of Diode**

```
   Anode (P) →|← Cathode (N)
```

* Arrow = Current ka direction (forward)
* Line = Blocking side

## **Key Features of P–N Junction Diode**

1. **Unidirectional Device** → Current only flows in forward direction.
2. **Forward Bias Condition** → When P is connected to +ve, diode conducts.
3. **Reverse Bias Condition** → When P is connected to –ve, diode does not conduct (except very small leakage).
4. **Threshold Voltage** → Minimum voltage required to start conduction.

   * For Silicon diode ≈ 0.7 V
   * For Germanium diode ≈ 0.3 V
5. **Applications** → Rectifiers, Clipping circuits, Voltage multipliers, etc.

## **Characteristics (VI Curve)**

* **Forward Bias Region**: Current starts after threshold voltage (0.7V for Si).
* **Reverse Bias Region**: Very small current (leakage).
* **Breakdown Region**: If reverse voltage exceeds a limit → diode gets damaged (except Zener diode).
